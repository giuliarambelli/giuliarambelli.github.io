abstract: Generics are statements that express generalizations and are used to communicate generalizable knowledge. While generics convey general truths (e.g., Birds can fly), they often allow for exceptions (e.g., penguins do not fly). Nonetheless, generics form the basis of how we communicate our commonsense about the world. We explored the interpretation of generics in Masked Language Models (MLMs), building on psycholinguistic experimental designs. As this interpretation requires a comparison with overtly quantified sentences, we investigated i) the probability of quantifiers, ii) the internal representation of nouns in generic vs. quantified sentences, and iii) whether the presence of a generic sentence as context influences quantifiersâ€™ probabilities. The outcomes confirm that MLMs are insensitive to quantification; nevertheless, they appear to encode a meaning associated with the generic form, which leads them to reshape the probability associated with various quantifiers when the generic sentence is provided as context.
