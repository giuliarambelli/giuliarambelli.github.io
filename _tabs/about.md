<div>Born in 1993 in Italy, lived in Viareggio (Lucca). </div>

<div>I got a PhD in Linguistic studies at the University of Pisa in  with the Aix-Marseille University (AMU), under the joint supervision of Alessandro Lenci and Philippe Blache. I was a member of the <a href="https://colinglab.humnet.unipi.it/people/rambelli/http://colinglab.humnet.unipi.it/">Computational Liguistics Laboratory </a>(University of Pisa) and of the <a href="https://colinglab.humnet.unipi.it/people/rambelli/http://www.lpl-aix.fr/">Laboratoire Parole et Language</a> (AMU). I also enrolled in the <a href="https://colinglab.humnet.unipi.it/people/rambelli/https://www.ilcb.fr/">Institute of Language, Communication, and the Brain (ILCB)</a> PhD Program.</div>

<div>Previously, I pursued my Bachelor's (2012-2015) and Master's (2015-2018) Degrees in Digital Humanities at the University of Pisa under the supervision of Alessandro Lenci. During this time, I carried out research on lexical-semantic interface and automatic lexical acquisition, that led to the realization of two resources, LexFr and UDLex.</div>

I had two Erasmus traineeship experiences in France, respectively in

2014: Laboratoire Parole et Language with Laurent Prévot (Aix-en-Provence)

<div>I have two flyffy cats, Mia and Modì, and I love street photography. </div>
